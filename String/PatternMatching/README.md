KMP Algorithm:

The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is used to find a given text from a specific word. 

This algorithm uses the degenerating property which primarily works based on sub-strings. 

The basic idea of this algorithm is to not match a character which is already known to match for sure.

Example:

Output: Enter the pattern to be found:

Input: cktober

Output : Enter the string in which the pattern is to be found: 

Input: hacktoberfest

Output/Answer: Pattern found at index: 2

Rabin Karp Algorithm

The Rabin karp Algorithm is used to search a text from a given word using hash function.

This algorithm doesnt search slide through every character but filters the unlike characters and then does the comparing.

Example:

Enter the pattern to be found: 

program

Enter the string in which the pattern is to be found: 

competitveprogramming

Pattern found at index: 10

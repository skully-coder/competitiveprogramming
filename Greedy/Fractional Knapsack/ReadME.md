# Fractional Knapsack

Given weights and values of N items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
Note: Unlike 0/1 knapsack, you are allowed to break the item. 

### Example 1:
```
Input:  
N = 3, W = 50
values[] = {60,100,120}
weight[] = {10,20,30}
Output: 
240.00
```

### Example 2:
```
Input:  
N = 2, W = 50
values[] = {60,100}
weight[] = {10,20}
Output: 
160.00
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= N <= 105
- 1 <= W <= 105

problem statement : We are given two sorted arrays, we need to merge these two arrays without using any extra space.(such that the initial numbers after sorting are in 
the first array and the remaining numbers are in the second array).

e.g:-
Input: arr1[] = {2, 5, 7, 12, 18, 20};
       arr2[] = {1, 3, 8, 13};
       
Output: arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
        arr2[] = {12, 13, 18, 20}

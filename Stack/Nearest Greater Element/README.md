Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element. The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in the array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider the next greater element as -1. 

Examples: 

    For an array, the rightmost element always has the next greater element as -1.
    For an array that is sorted in decreasing order, all elements have the next greater element as -1.
    For the input array [4, 5, 2, 25], the next greater elements for each element are as follows.

Element       NGE
   4      -->   5
   5      -->   25
   2      -->   25
   25     -->   -1

Problem Statement: We are given two sorted arrays, we need to merge these two arrays without using any extra space (merge such that the initial numbers after sorting 
                    are in the first array and the remaining numbers are in the second array.
                    
e.g.-

  Input: ar1[] = {2, 5, 7, 13, 18, 20};
       ar2[] = {1, 4, 8, 17};
       
  Output: ar1[] = {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}
        ar2[] = {13, 17, 18, 20}

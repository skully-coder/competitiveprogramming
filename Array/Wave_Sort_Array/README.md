# Wave sort array program

Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like 
array and return it. In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that 
a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5..... (considering the increasing lexicographical order).

Example 1->
Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}

Output: 2 1 4 3 5
Explanation: Array elements after sorting it in wave form would be
2 1 4 3 5.

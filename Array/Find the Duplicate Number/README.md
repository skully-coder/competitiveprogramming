#Find the Duplicate Number

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.
There is only one repeated number in `nums`, return this repeated number.

###TestCase 1
```
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

###TestCase 2
```
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

###TestCase 3
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 1
```

###Constraints
```
1 <= n <= 105
nums.length == n + 1
1 <= nums[i] <= n
All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.

# QUICK SORT

Quicksort is an in-place sorting algorithm.Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. 
It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, 
according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, 
it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort.The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. 
This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.

# 989. Add to Array-Form of Integer
The array-form of an integer num is an array representing its digits in left to right order.

For example, for num = 1321, the array form is `[1,3,2,1]`.
Given num, the array-form of an integer, and an integer k, return the array-form of the integer num + k.

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: num = [1,2,0,0], k = 34
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Explanation: 1200 + 34 = 1234
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: num = [2,7,4], k = 181
Output: [4,5,5]
Explanation: 274 + 181 = 455
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: num = [2,1,5], k = 806
Output: [1,0,2,1]
Explanation: 215 + 806 = 1021
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: num = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9], k = 1
Output: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: 9999999999 + 1 = 10000000000
```

### Constraints:
```
1 <= num.length <= 104
0 <= num[i] <= 9
num does not contain any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
1 <= k <= 104
```
